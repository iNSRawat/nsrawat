```python
from sklearn.pipeline import Pipeline
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

# Create pipeline
pipeline = Pipeline([
    ('scaler', StandardScaler()),
    ('classifier', RandomForestClassifier())
])

# Train
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y)
pipeline.fit(X_train, y_train)
score = pipeline.score(X_test, y_test)
```
