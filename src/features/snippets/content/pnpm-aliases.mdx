## Install & Upgrade pnpm

Install pnpm globally using npm:

```bash
npm i -g pnpm
```

Upgrade to the latest version:

```bash
npm i -g pnpm@latest
```

## Add Shell Alias

Open your shell profile file:

```bash
code ~/.zprofile  # or code ~/.bash_profile
```

Add the following line:

```bash
alias pn=pnpm
```

Reload it:

```bash
source ~/.zprofile  # or source ~/.bash_profile
```

Now you can use `pn` instead of `pnpm`:

```bash
pn -v  # Check pnpm version
```

## Upgrade Project Dependencies

Interactively upgrade all dependencies to the latest version:

```bash
pnpm up -i -L
```

This shows a list of packages that can be upgraded and lets you select which ones to update.
