## Introduction

Machine Learning (ML) has revolutionized how we approach problem-solving in the digital age. From recommendation engines on Netflix to fraud detection systems in banking, ML algorithms are the engines driving intelligent decision-making.

For data scientists, understanding "which algorithm to use when" is a fundamental skill.

## 1. Supervised Learning: Regression

Regression algorithms are used when the output variable is a continuous numerical value.

### Linear Regression

The "Hello World" of machine learning. It attempts to model the relationship between variables by fitting a linear equation.

```python
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2)
model = LinearRegression()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)
predictions = model.predict(X_test)
```

## 2. Supervised Learning: Classification

Classification algorithms predict categorical outcomes.

### Random Forests

An ensemble of many decision trees, which reduces overfitting and improves accuracy.

```python
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier

rf_model = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100, random_state=42)
rf_model.fit(X_train, y_train)
importances = rf_model.feature_importances_
```

---

## 3. Unsupervised Learning: Clustering

### K-Means Clustering

Partitions data into K distinct clusters based on distance to the centroid.

```python
from sklearn.cluster import KMeans

kmeans = KMeans(n_clusters=3)
kmeans.fit(data)
labels = kmeans.labels_
```

## 4. Gradient Boosting (Kaggle Winners)

### XGBoost, LightGBM, CatBoost

These are the heavy hitters in tabular data problems.

```python
import xgboost as xgb

model = xgb.XGBClassifier(learning_rate=0.1, n_estimators=1000, max_depth=5)
model.fit(X_train, y_train)
```

## Cheat Sheet: Which Algorithm to Choose?

| Data Type         | Suggested Algorithms                 |
| :---------------- | :----------------------------------- |
| **Tabular Data**  | XGBoost, LightGBM, Random Forest     |
| **Images**        | CNNs (Convolutional Neural Networks) |
| **Text**          | Transformers (BERT, GPT), SVM        |
| **Small Dataset** | Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes     |
| **Clustering**    | K-Means, DBSCAN                      |

## Conclusion

The best data scientists aren't just those who know the algorithms, but those who know **when** to apply them.

Happy Modeling! 🚀
