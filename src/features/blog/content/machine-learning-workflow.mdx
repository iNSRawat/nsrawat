## The ML Workflow

Every machine learning project follows a systematic workflow. Understanding this process is crucial for success.

---

## 1. Problem Definition

Before writing any code, clearly define:

- What problem are you solving?
- What is the target variable?
- What metrics will define success?

---

## 2. Data Collection & Preparation

```python
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

# Load data
df = pd.read_csv('dataset.csv')

# Split features and target
X = df.drop('target', axis=1)
y = df['target']

# Train/test split
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(
    X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42
)
```

---

## 3. Feature Engineering

```python
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler, OneHotEncoder
from sklearn.compose import ColumnTransformer

# Define preprocessing
numeric_features = ['age', 'income']
categorical_features = ['category', 'region']

preprocessor = ColumnTransformer([
    ('num', StandardScaler(), numeric_features),
    ('cat', OneHotEncoder(), categorical_features)
])
```

---

## 4. Model Training

```python
from sklearn.pipeline import Pipeline
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier

# Create pipeline
pipeline = Pipeline([
    ('preprocessor', preprocessor),
    ('classifier', RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100))
])

# Train
pipeline.fit(X_train, y_train)
```

---

## 5. Model Evaluation

```python
from sklearn.metrics import classification_report, confusion_matrix

# Predictions
y_pred = pipeline.predict(X_test)

# Evaluation
print(classification_report(y_test, y_pred))
print(confusion_matrix(y_test, y_pred))
```

---

## 6. Hyperparameter Tuning

```python
from sklearn.model_selection import GridSearchCV

param_grid = {
    'classifier__n_estimators': [50, 100, 200],
    'classifier__max_depth': [5, 10, None]
}

grid_search = GridSearchCV(pipeline, param_grid, cv=5)
grid_search.fit(X_train, y_train)

print(f"Best params: {grid_search.best_params_}")
```

---

## 7. Model Deployment

```python
import joblib

# Save model
joblib.dump(pipeline, 'model.pkl')

# Load model
loaded_model = joblib.load('model.pkl')
predictions = loaded_model.predict(new_data)
```

---

## Key Takeaways

1. **Iterate** - ML is iterative, not linear
2. **Validate** - Always use cross-validation
3. **Document** - Track experiments and results
4. **Monitor** - Models degrade over time

Happy Building! 🚀
