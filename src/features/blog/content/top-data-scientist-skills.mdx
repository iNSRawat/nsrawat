## Technical Skills

### 1. Python Programming

Python remains the **undisputed king** of data science programming languages. Its extensive ecosystem of libraries makes it indispensable:

```python
# Essential Python libraries for data science
import numpy as np          # Numerical computing
import pandas as pd         # Data manipulation
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt  # Visualization
import seaborn as sns       # Statistical visualization
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
```

**Key Libraries to Master:**

- **NumPy**: Numerical computing and array operations
- **Pandas**: Data manipulation and analysis
- **Matplotlib/Seaborn**: Data visualization
- **Scikit-learn**: Machine learning algorithms

---

### 2. SQL (Structured Query Language)

SQL is fundamental for working with relational databases, where most business data resides. Over **80% of data** used in analytics comes from SQL databases.

```sql
-- Example: Customer segmentation query
SELECT
    customer_segment,
    COUNT(*) as customer_count,
    AVG(total_purchases) as avg_purchases,
    SUM(revenue) as total_revenue
FROM customers
WHERE signup_date >= '2025-01-01'
GROUP BY customer_segment
ORDER BY total_revenue DESC;
```

**SQL Skills to Master:**

- Complex JOINs and subqueries
- Window functions (ROW_NUMBER, RANK, LAG, LEAD)
- CTEs (Common Table Expressions)
- Query optimization and indexing

---

### 3. Machine Learning

Understanding machine learning algorithms is at the core of data science. You should be proficient in:

| Algorithm Type                    | Examples                      | Use Cases                         |
| :-------------------------------- | :---------------------------- | :-------------------------------- |
| **Supervised - Regression**       | Linear, Ridge, Lasso          | Price prediction, forecasting     |
| **Supervised - Classification**   | Random Forest, XGBoost, SVM   | Churn prediction, fraud detection |
| **Unsupervised - Clustering**     | K-Means, DBSCAN, Hierarchical | Customer segmentation             |
| **Unsupervised - Dimensionality** | PCA, t-SNE, UMAP              | Feature reduction, visualization  |

```python
# Building a complete ML pipeline
from sklearn.pipeline import Pipeline
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
from sklearn.ensemble import GradientBoostingClassifier

pipeline = Pipeline([
    ('scaler', StandardScaler()),
    ('classifier', GradientBoostingClassifier(n_estimators=100))
])

pipeline.fit(X_train, y_train)
score = pipeline.score(X_test, y_test)
```

### 4. Deep Learning & Neural Networks

With the rise of AI, deep learning skills are increasingly valuable:

- **TensorFlow/Keras**: Production-ready deep learning
- **PyTorch**: Research and experimentation
- **Transformer models**: BERT, GPT for NLP tasks
- **CNNs**: Image classification and computer vision

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Dense, Dropout

model = Sequential([
    Dense(128, activation='relu', input_shape=(n_features,)),
    Dropout(0.3),
    Dense(64, activation='relu'),
    Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')
])

model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='binary_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])
```

---

### 5. Statistics & Probability

A strong foundation in statistics is **non-negotiable**:

- **Descriptive Statistics**: Mean, median, mode, standard deviation
- **Inferential Statistics**: Hypothesis testing, confidence intervals
- **Probability Distributions**: Normal, binomial, Poisson
- **Bayesian Statistics**: Prior, posterior, likelihood

```python
from scipy import stats

# Hypothesis testing example
t_statistic, p_value = stats.ttest_ind(group_a, group_b)

if p_value < 0.05:
    print("Statistically significant difference!")
else:
    print("No significant difference found.")
```

---

### 6. Data Visualization

The ability to communicate insights visually is critical. Master these tools:

- **Python**: Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly
- **BI Tools**: Tableau, Power BI, Looker Studio
- **Interactive Dashboards**: Streamlit, Dash

```python
import plotly.express as px

fig = px.scatter(df,
                 x='feature_1',
                 y='feature_2',
                 color='target',
                 title='Feature Analysis',
                 hover_data=['customer_id'])
fig.show()
```

---

### 7. Cloud Computing

Modern data science requires cloud proficiency:

| Platform         | Key Services                            |
| :--------------- | :-------------------------------------- |
| **AWS**          | SageMaker, S3, Redshift, EMR            |
| **Google Cloud** | BigQuery, Vertex AI, Dataflow           |
| **Azure**        | Azure ML, Synapse Analytics, Databricks |

---

### 8. Big Data Technologies

When datasets exceed local memory, you need:

- **Apache Spark**: Distributed data processing
- **Hadoop**: HDFS for distributed storage
- **Dask**: Parallel computing in Python
- **Apache Kafka**: Real-time data streaming

---

### 9. MLOps & Model Deployment

Building models is only half the battle—deploying them is crucial:

- **Docker**: Containerization
- **Kubernetes**: Container orchestration
- **MLflow**: Experiment tracking and model registry
- **CI/CD Pipelines**: Automated testing and deployment

```python
# Example: Saving model with MLflow
import mlflow

with mlflow.start_run():
    mlflow.log_params({"n_estimators": 100, "max_depth": 5})
    mlflow.log_metric("accuracy", accuracy_score)
    mlflow.sklearn.log_model(model, "model")
```

---

### 10. Data Cleaning & Wrangling

Data scientists spend **60-80% of their time** preparing data:

```python
import pandas as pd

# Common data cleaning operations
df = df.drop_duplicates()
df = df.dropna(subset=['critical_column'])
df['date'] = pd.to_datetime(df['date'])
df['category'] = df['category'].str.lower().str.strip()
df['amount'] = df['amount'].fillna(df['amount'].median())
```
